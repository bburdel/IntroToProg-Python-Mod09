# IntroToProg-Python-Mod09
Assignment 09 module files and main script file. TEST -- publish through git via command console. 

This was a test to see if I could push files from my local repository to my remote GitHub repository. 

It worked but the files include .pyc files I should have added to the .gitignore file. Rookie mistake.
